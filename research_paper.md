# AI Debate Simulator: A Multi-Agent System for Domain-Specific Knowledge-Based Debates

## Abstract

This paper presents an innovative approach to simulating intellectual debates using multiple AI agents equipped with domain-specific knowledge bases. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable meaningful discussions between AI agents representing different fields of expertise. Our implementation demonstrates how specialized knowledge can be integrated into conversational AI systems to produce coherent, context-aware debates on complex topics.

## 1. Introduction

The advancement of Large Language Models has opened new possibilities in AI-driven conversation and debate. However, these models often lack domain-specific expertise and consistent knowledge application. Our AI Debate Simulator addresses these limitations by combining specialized knowledge bases with LLM capabilities, creating a structured environment for multi-agent debates.

### 1.1 Motivation

Current AI systems often struggle with:
- Maintaining consistent domain expertise
- Integrating specialized knowledge in conversations
- Structured multi-participant discussions
- Real-time debate management

The AI Debate Simulator aims to overcome these challenges through a novel architecture combining knowledge bases, specialized agents, and orchestrated interactions.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Multi-Agent Systems
Previous research in multi-agent systems has focused on collaborative problem-solving and competitive scenarios. However, few systems have addressed structured debate formats with domain-specific knowledge integration.

### 2.2 Knowledge-Enhanced LLMs
Recent work on augmenting LLMs with external knowledge has shown promising results. Our approach builds upon these advances by incorporating domain-specific knowledge bases for each agent.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Core Components

The system comprises four main components:

1. **Agent System**
   - Domain-specific AI agents
   - Knowledge base integration
   - Response generation logic

2. **Debate Orchestrator**
   - Turn management
   - Context maintenance
   - Debate flow control

3. **Knowledge Base System**
   - Domain-specific information storage
   - RAG implementation
   - Dynamic knowledge retrieval

4. **Web Interface**
   - Real-time debate visualization
   - User interaction
   - Status monitoring

### 3.2 Agent Architecture

Each agent in the system is designed with:
- Domain expertise definition
- Knowledge base connection
- Context awareness
- LLM integration

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Technology Stack

The system is implemented using:
- Python Flask for backend services
- Ollama for LLM integration
- RAG for knowledge retrieval
- Asynchronous programming for debate management

### 4.2 Knowledge Integration

Domain knowledge is integrated through:
```python
def enhance_prompt(self, prompt: str, domain: str) -> str:
    # Combine prompt with domain-specific knowledge
    enhanced_prompt = self.knowledge_base.enhance_prompt(prompt, domain)
    return enhanced_prompt
```

### 4.3 Debate Flow Control

The orchestrator manages debates through:
```python
async def conduct_round(self) -> None:
    for agent in self.agents:
        prompt = self._generate_prompt(agent, context)
        response = await agent.generate_response(prompt, context)
```

## 5. Results & Discussion

### 5.1 System Performance

Initial testing demonstrates:
- Coherent multi-turn conversations
- Effective domain knowledge integration
- Scalable debate management
- Real-time response generation

### 5.2 Knowledge Integration Effectiveness

The RAG system shows significant improvements in:
- Response relevance
- Domain expertise maintenance
- Factual accuracy

### 5.3 Limitations

Current limitations include:
- LLM response time constraints
- Knowledge base coverage gaps
- Cross-domain knowledge integration challenges

## 6. Future Work

Planned improvements include:
1. Enhanced knowledge base integration
2. Multiple LLM backend support
3. Advanced debate formats
4. Improved summarization capabilities

## 7. Conclusion

The AI Debate Simulator demonstrates the feasibility of creating structured, knowledge-enhanced debates between AI agents. The system's architecture provides a foundation for future research in multi-agent systems and knowledge-enhanced conversational AI.
